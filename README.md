# Smile On Project

Smile On 60+ is a Tennessee program that offers oral healthcare to Tennessee residents that are 60 years and older, low income, and don't have dental insurance. The program provides support of oral healthcare, education, and transportation.

# Data Questions  
For this project we will be answering two questions to evaluate the Smile On program:  
1. Has the Smile On program been effective?  
2. Is the Smile On program being used by people in the area where tooth loss is greatest?  

# Smile On Data
Information about patients is gathered during different interactions (initial visit, checkups, etc.). The data in the `data` folder include records through November 28. There is also a data dictionary that contains some useful information about the different columns.

# Team Contribution
For this team project, my team decided to investigate the number of patients whose mouths were 'restored to function' as of their last dental visit with the program and made this one of our metrics for determining program effectiveness. A patient who has been 'restored to function' is able to chew and has their front six teeth present, which we know equates to improved quality of life. Our visual highlights the clinics that were able to restore the most patients to function.

We also created the visual showing the prevalence of complete tooth loss in major cities in Tennessee and highlighted Chattanooga as a potential opportunity for Smile On to increase their presence. Lastly, we were involved in creating some of the visuals about the demographic make-up of their current patients. The full presentation is available in the repository.

This projects required us to continually refine our approach in handling null values and be critical about how we displayed the data and how we communicated our approach to the client. It also required us to be intentional and persistent in our communication with other groups in the class since our visuals would become a part of a larger story.
